# Hill Valley with and without Noise

This project explores a dataset of **Hill Valley** with and without noise. The Hill Valley dataset is often used to demonstrate data preprocessing, noise filtering, and the impact of noise on data analysis. In this project, the focus is on applying and comparing methods for noise reduction on a noisy version of the Hill Valley dataset.

## Introduction

The **Hill Valley dataset** includes data related to features that may include environmental and geographical parameters, and it is commonly used for modeling or simulation tasks. In this project, we introduce **noise** to the dataset in order to simulate real-world scenarios where data may not be perfect due to measurement errors, external disturbances, or other factors.

Noise is introduced into the dataset through random alterations, and various techniques are explored to filter out this noise, improving data quality for subsequent analysis.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to analyze the effect of noise on the Hill Valley dataset and explore methods for reducing the noise. We have two versions of the data:

- **Hill Valley Without Noise**: This is the clean dataset, with no alterations or disturbances.
- **Hill Valley With Noise**: This dataset has random noise added to its features, which can mimic errors or data corruption.

By comparing the two, we can analyze the effectiveness of different noise reduction techniques and their impact on machine learning models trained on the data.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of various features related to Hill Valley data. Here are the key features:

- **Feature 1**: A numerical representation of geographical feature X.
- **Feature 2**: A numerical representation of environmental feature Y.
- **Feature 3**: A time series or location-based feature.
- **Target Variable**: The target or outcome variable we aim to predict or analyze (e.g., performance, classification, or regression task).

The dataset has been artificially modified to add noise in the second version, where values are randomly altered based on a specified noise factor.

## Data Processing

### Without Noise
This version of the dataset is clean and ready for analysis. It can be used as a baseline to compare the impact of noise reduction techniques.

### With Noise
Noise is added to the dataset using a random Gaussian function or other noise-generating methods, and the resulting dataset is analyzed to understand how well machine learning models perform with noisy data.

## Noise Analysis

In this project, we simulate noise using the following methods:

1. **Gaussian Noise**: Adding random Gaussian noise to the dataset features.
2. **Uniform Noise**: Introducing uniform noise to the features.
3. **Outliers**: Adding extreme outlier values to simulate the effect of unexpected errors or misreads in the data.

These different types of noise help assess the robustness of various models and the impact of preprocessing steps in machine learning.

## Key Visualizations

We create visualizations to better understand the differences between the noisy and clean versions of the data:

1. **Histogram of Features**: Show the distribution of the features for both the clean and noisy datasets.
2. **Scatter Plot Comparison**: A scatter plot to visualize the impact of noise on the relationships between features.
3. **Noise vs Model Accuracy**: Graph showing how the introduction of noise impacts the performance of a machine learning model, such as decision trees, regression models, etc.
4. **Before and After Noise Filtering**: A plot to show how the dataset looks before and after applying noise reduction techniques like smoothing or dimensionality reduction.
